# The [Library assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) from The Odin Project.

## Requirements:
* Essentially, create `Book` objects, and store them in an array 
* Display the books on an Html page
* Provide a "New Book" button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details
* Add a "Remove" button to each book
* Add a button to each book, to toggle its "read" status (use a `Book` prototype function for this task)
* Initially, do not create any type of storage to save the information between reloads (this will likely be added later)
